## Multi-Omics Analysis for Therapeutic Target Discovery

**Project Focus**: Mechanisms of Fezf2 mutation in cortical development and identification of therapeutic targets
**Target Journals**: Nature, Cell, Nature Neuroscience, Neuron
**Analysis Approach**: Advanced computational methods with multi-omics integration
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-25

---

## Executive Summary

This research plan leverages the comprehensive GSE153164 dataset (Di Bella et al. 2021) to investigate the temporal and cell-type-specific mechanisms by which Fezf2 mutations disrupt cortical development. Unlike the existing tutorial focusing only on P1 wild-type vs knockout comparisons, this plan will:

1. **Exploit the full developmental time course** (E10-P4) to identify critical temporal windows
2. **Analyze gene dosage effects** using heterozygous samples (WT → Het → KO)
3. **Integrate scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq** to map gene regulatory networks
4. **Reconstruct developmental trajectories** and identify perturbed cell fate decisions
5. **Identify compensatory mechanisms and therapeutic targets** through multi-level analysis

**Key Innovation**: This will be the first comprehensive multi-omics analysis characterizing dose-dependent, temporal, and cell-type-specific effects of Fezf2 deficiency across cortical development.

## 2. Research Questions & Hypotheses

### Theme 1: Temporal Dynamics of Fezf2 Mutation Effects

#### RQ1.1: When do Fezf2 mutation phenotypes first emerge during cortical development?

**Hypothesis 1.1a**: Fezf2 deficiency causes the earliest detectable transcriptional changes at E13-E14 when corticofugal projection neurons begin to differentiate, coinciding with peak endogenous Fezf2 expression.

**Hypothesis 1.1b**: Different cell types show distinct temporal windows of vulnerability, with early-born deep layer neurons (E11-E13) being more severely affected than late-born upper layer neurons (E15-E17).

**Analysis Approach**:
- Time-resolved DEG analysis across all developmental stages
- Change-point detection to identify critical transition periods
- Cell-type-specific temporal profiling
- Compare WT developmental trajectory with Het/KO trajectories

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Temporal map of transcriptional dysregulation
- Identification of "critical windows" for intervention
- Cell-type-specific vulnerability timelines

---

#### RQ1.2: How do developmental trajectories diverge between WT, Het, and KO conditions?

**Hypothesis 1.2a**: Fezf2 KO leads to aberrant cell fate decisions, with progenitor cells failing to properly differentiate into corticofugal projection neurons and instead adopting alternative neuronal or glial fates.

**Hypothesis 1.2b**: Trajectory bifurcations occur progressively earlier in development in KO compared to Het, suggesting a dose-dependent acceleration of phenotypic divergence.

**Analysis Approach**:
- RNA velocity analysis (scVelo, VeloViz)
- Trajectory inference (Monocle3, PAGA, Slingshot)
- Partition-based graph abstraction to map lineage trees
- Quantify trajectory divergence metrics (KL divergence, Wasserstein distance)

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Reconstructed lineage trajectories for WT, Het, KO
- Identification of specific bifurcation points where cell fate is altered
- Quantitative metrics of developmental trajectory perturbation

---

### Theme 2: Gene Dosage Effects & Compensatory Mechanisms

#### RQ2.1: Does Fezf2 haploinsufficiency trigger compensatory transcriptional responses?

**Hypothesis 2.1a**: Heterozygous mice activate compensatory gene expression programs that partially buffer against Fezf2 loss, resulting in intermediate phenotypes between WT and KO.

**Hypothesis 2.1b**: Specific transcription factors (e.g., Ctip2/Bcl11b, Tbr1, Sox5) show dose-dependent upregulation in Het and KO to compensate for Fezf2 deficiency.

**Hypothesis 2.1c**: Compensatory mechanisms are cell-type-specific, with some populations (e.g., radial glia, intermediate progenitors) showing robust compensation while others (e.g., committed projection neurons) show limited adaptation.

**Analysis Approach**:
- Dose-response modeling (WT → Het → KO) for each gene
- Identify genes with:
  - **Linear responses**: Gene expression proportional to Fezf2 dosage
  - **Threshold responses**: No change until complete KO
  - **Compensatory responses**: Upregulation in Het/KO
  - **Synergistic responses**: Greater than additive effects in KO
- Cell-type-stratified dose-response analysis
- Network analysis to identify compensatory regulatory modules

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Classification of genes by dose-response patterns
- Identification of candidate compensatory mechanisms
- Cell-type-specific buffering capacities
- Potential therapeutic targets that enhance compensation

---

#### RQ2.2: Are there sex-specific responses to Fezf2 haploinsufficiency?

**Hypothesis 2.2**: Male and female heterozygous mice show sexually dimorphic compensatory mechanisms, with potential implications for sex differences in neurodevelopmental disorders.

**Analysis Approach**:
- Compare P1 Fezf2Het Female vs Male transcriptomes
- Identify sex-specific DEGs and pathways
- Analyze X/Y chromosome gene expression
- Investigate sex hormone pathway activation

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Sex-dimorphic gene expression signatures in Het condition
- Insights into sexual dimorphism in cortical development
- Potential explanations for sex bias in neurodevelopmental disorders

---

### Theme 3: Gene Regulatory Network Perturbations

#### RQ3.1: How does Fezf2 deficiency reshape gene regulatory networks during cortical development?

**Hypothesis 3.1a**: Fezf2 functions as a master regulator orchestrating a hierarchical transcriptional cascade. Its loss causes network-wide dysregulation affecting hundreds of downstream targets and regulatory feedback loops.

**Hypothesis 3.1b**: Multi-omics integration (scRNA-seq + scATAC-seq) will reveal that Fezf2 directly regulates chromatin accessibility at enhancers of corticofugal neuron specification genes.

**Hypothesis 3.1c**: Fezf2 deficiency leads to aberrant activation of normally repressed regulatory programs (e.g., callosal projection neuron programs).

**Analysis Approach**:
- **Gene Regulatory Network (GRN) reconstruction**:
  - SCENIC (pySCENIC) for regulon inference
  - CellOracle for GRN perturbation modeling
  - GRNBoost2 for TF-target predictions
- **Multi-omics integration at matched timepoints (E13, E15, E18)**:
  - Integrate scRNA-seq + scATAC-seq using:
    - Seurat WNN (Weighted Nearest Neighbor)
    - MOFA+ (Multi-Omics Factor Analysis)
    - Signac for chromatin analysis
  - Link peaks to genes (enhancer-promoter linkage)
  - TF footprinting in ATAC-seq peaks
  - Motif enrichment in differentially accessible regions
- **Comparative network analysis**:
  - Reconstruct GRNs for WT, Het, KO
  - Identify network hubs and bottlenecks
  - Calculate network centrality metrics
  - Detect rewired regulatory modules

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Comprehensive Fezf2-centered GRN across development
- Direct vs. indirect targets of Fezf2
- Chromatin accessibility changes linked to gene expression
- Aberrantly activated/repressed regulatory programs
- Network vulnerabilities and intervention points

---

#### RQ3.2: What are the direct transcriptional targets of Fezf2 in developing cortical neurons?

**Hypothesis 3.2a**: Integration of ATAC-seq with RNA-seq will identify ~100-500 high-confidence direct targets of Fezf2, enriched for genes involved in axon guidance, neuronal migration, and synaptic specification.

**Hypothesis 3.2b**: Fezf2 binding motifs will be enriched in differentially accessible chromatin regions near downregulated genes in KO.

**Analysis Approach**:
- Differential accessibility analysis (DA) between WT and KO at E13, E15, E18
- Motif enrichment in DA regions (HOMER, chromVAR)
- Link DA peaks to nearby genes
- Correlate chromatin accessibility with gene expression
- Filter for Fezf2 motif + decreased accessibility in KO + decreased gene expression in KO
- Validate against published Fezf2 ChIP-seq data if available

**Expected Outcomes**:
- High-confidence direct target gene list
- Fezf2 regulatory motifs and binding sites
- Enhancer-gene linkage map
- Prioritized targets for functional validation

---

### Theme 4: Cell-Type-Specific Vulnerabilities

#### RQ4.1: Which cell types and developmental states are most vulnerable to Fezf2 deficiency?

**Hypothesis 4.1a**: Cells in transitional states (e.g., differentiating projection neurons) show the greatest transcriptional dysregulation, while stable populations (e.g., mature interneurons, mature glial cells) are relatively spared.

**Hypothesis 4.1b**: Corticofugal projection neurons (subcerebral projection neurons) show the most severe and earliest defects, while callosal projection neurons may show compensatory expansion.

**Hypothesis 4.1c**: Radial glia progenitors and intermediate progenitor cells show subtle but significant defects in neurogenic programs that cascade into neuronal defects.

**Analysis Approach**:
- High-resolution cell type annotation across all conditions and timepoints
- Cell-type-specific differential expression analysis
- Quantify cell type proportions across conditions (compositional analysis)
- Pseudotime ordering within each cell type lineage
- Identify transitional cell states and their vulnerability
- Cell-cell communication analysis (CellChat, NicheNet)

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Ranked vulnerability map of cell types
- Cell type proportion changes (fate shifts)
- Transitional states most affected by Fezf2 loss
- Altered cell-cell communication networks

---

#### RQ4.2: Are there rare or transitional cell populations that emerge specifically in mutant conditions?

**Hypothesis 4.2**: Fezf2 KO leads to the emergence of aberrant transitional cell states with mixed identity (e.g., cells co-expressing markers of different neuronal subtypes) that may represent developmental "dead ends."

**Analysis Approach**:
- Rare cell type detection (scDRS, RamanNet)
- Cluster-specific marker analysis
- Trajectory dead-end detection
- Entropy-based cell state stability analysis
- Compare cell state landscapes between WT and KO

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Novel aberrant cell states in mutants
- Developmental "traps" or dead-end trajectories
- Cellular heterogeneity metrics

---

### Theme 5: Therapeutic Target Discovery

#### RQ5.1: Can we identify druggable targets that rescue or ameliorate Fezf2 deficiency phenotypes?

**Hypothesis 5.1a**: Compensatory upregulation of functionally related transcription factors (e.g., Ctip2/Bcl11b) in Het condition suggests that therapeutic enhancement of these pathways could rescue KO phenotypes.

**Hypothesis 5.1b**: Genes showing intermediate expression in Het but complete loss in KO represent dose-sensitive therapeutic targets.

**Hypothesis 5.1c**: Perturbations in druggable pathways (e.g., signaling pathways, epigenetic regulators, metabolic pathways) in KO can be targeted pharmacologically.

**Analysis Approach**:
- **Identify druggable gene categories**:
  - GPCRs (G-protein coupled receptors)
  - Kinases and phosphatases
  - Ion channels
  - Nuclear receptors
  - Epigenetic modifiers (HDACs, methyltransferases)
- **Drug-gene interaction databases**:
  - DGIdb (Drug-Gene Interaction Database)
  - ChEMBL, DrugBank
  - Connectivity Map (CMap) for drug repurposing

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Prioritized list of 10-50 druggable therapeutic targets
- Repurposing candidates from existing drugs
- Predicted combination therapy strategies
- Mechanistic rationale for each target

---

#### RQ5.2: Can we predict critical intervention windows for maximal therapeutic efficacy?

**Hypothesis 5.2**: There exist critical developmental windows where intervention would be most effective, likely corresponding to periods of peak Fezf2 expression and maximal phenotypic divergence.

**Analysis Approach**:
- Time-resolved phenotype severity scoring
- Trajectory divergence time-point analysis
- Reversibility modeling (can trajectory be "corrected"?)
- Identify "point of no return" in developmental trajectories

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Therapeutic window recommendations
- Stage-specific intervention strategies
- Prognostic biomarkers for early detection
